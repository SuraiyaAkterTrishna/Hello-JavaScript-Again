/* IQ: What is variable?
A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. 

** Five things to write a variable: 
1. var (The var statement declares a variable)
2. Variable name (variables must be identified with unique names
3. Assignment operator “=” (use an “=” operator to assign a value)
4. Value (specifies the value to assign to the variable
5. Semicolon ; (use a semicolon to indicate the end of var statement)

Note:  A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
